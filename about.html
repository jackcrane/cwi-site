        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Dissapointed by the cancellation of the 2021 world championships, FTC Team 14365 decided to create our own world championship to be held in Cincinnati, Ohio in July of 2021</p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>To be considered for participation, teams must be in good standing and should be accomplished. CWI will initially be made open to the top 15 teams in every state, and the availability of more spaces will grow depending on space not taken by top teams.</p>
        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>CWI will continue to use the remote Ultimate Goal field and will follow the most recent ruleset and updates. The tournament will not be competed in an alliance-selection format like most FTC tournaments, but will rather be a bracket-based format, featuring a winners and losers bracket. In addition to the robot game, teams will be given an opportunity to present their season's accomplishments to a panel of judges and field questions during a formal interview and during pit visits.</p>
        <h3>Awards</h3>
        <p>Similar to a standard FTC tournament, we will be giving out an Inspire Award, Innovate Award, and Control Award. Other special awards will be given and will be announced during the opening ceremony, and given out at the closign ceremony</p>
        <h3>COVID Protocols</h3>
        <p>All participants, parents, coaches, and guests will be expected to wear face masks, regardless of situations. Guests who are either unable or unwilling to wear a mask are welcome to watch the event virtually on Twitch. During the event, blatant COVID protocol breaches will be assessed on a case-by-case basis but may result in dismissal from the venue. Teammates, coaches, and mentors observed violating social distancing guidelines during matches will be assessed a major penalty for each 5 seconds of violation.</p>
